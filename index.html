            can enjoy the nature not only in the countryside but also in all
            Latvian towns, Rīga included. If you are a flower lover, I highly
            recommend to visit

            resort town stretching 32 km (20 miles) and sandwiched between the
            Gulf of Riga and the Lielupe River.
